Groovy Fixtures

The goal of this project is to provide a simple test fixtures approach with a simple DSL developed in groovy. You can create and receive fixtures from a Fixtures facade besides loading a default set of common fixtures in a resources package called fixtures (default). 
The jpa entities can be developed in Java as well, you can also use a java compatible fixture facade from JUnit tests written in Java. 

This project is strongly influenced by the great fixtures and test-data plugins of Grails. The advantage is that you can use fixtures outside of Grails (e.g. using Spring-Boot with Groovy or if you want to test your Java-Project with Cucumber&Groovy step implementations).
